# main.py need to run for the AI Agent
The repository ollama_pdf_rag-AI_agent appears to be a project that implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Ollama, a platform for running large language models locally. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

üß† Core Concept: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG enhances the capabilities of language models by allowing them to retrieve relevant information from external sources (like PDFs) before generating a response. This makes the AI more accurate and context-aware.

‚öôÔ∏è How the System Works
PDF Upload & Processing

Users upload PDF documents.
The system extracts text from these PDFs and splits it into manageable chunks.
Embedding & Vector Storage

Each chunk is converted into a vector embedding using a model like mxbai-embed-large.
These embeddings are stored in a vector database (e.g., ChromaDB).
Query Handling

When a user asks a question, the query is also embedded.
The system searches the vector database for the most relevant chunks of text.
Response Generation

The retrieved chunks are passed to a local LLM (e.g., llama3 via Ollama).
The model uses this context to generate a grounded and accurate response.
üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Ollama: Runs LLMs locally (like llama3, dolphin-llama3).
LangChain: Manages the RAG pipeline and interactions.
ChromaDB: Stores and retrieves vector embeddings.
Python: Main programming language.
PDF/Text/JSON Support: Accepts multiple file formats for ingestion.
üìÅ Typical Files in the Repo
upload.py: Handles file ingestion and embedding.
localrag.py: Runs the RAG pipeline locally.
requirements.txt: Lists dependencies.
README.md: Explains setup and usage.
